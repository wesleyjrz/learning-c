# C Exercises

### About

This repository contains all the exercises I did while learning to program in C
through the book **"The C Programming Language: Second Edition"** by
[Brian W. Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Dennis M. Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) (original designer of the language).
However I don't limit myself, there's a directory named `extra` inside every
chapter directory with experiments I did in the language during my learning
process.

#### Rules

- All the code follows the ANSI C standard.
- The exercises doesn't have any functionalities that weren't presented at the moment I did it. Except for some special cases when I really want to do a complex thing because I'm excited about the exercise, in this cases I will leave a note in the header of the code.
